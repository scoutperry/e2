    <h1>Project One: Matching Pennies</h1>
<p>Player A picks either odd or even. Player B defaults to the opposing choice. <br> 
Both players flip a coin. If both pennies match the result is even and the <br> 
player that chose even wins. If the pennies land on different sides the result is <br>
odd and the player that chose odd wins.  <p>
